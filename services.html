				<h3>IB Registration</h3>
				<p>Registration of a sole proprietorship with the tax authorities is not a complicated procedure. It can be done both in person and by submitting all the necessary documents online. However, despite the apparent simplicity, before opening a sole proprietorship it is necessary to think in advance about such issues as the choice of tax regime, types of activity, etc. And here one cannot do without the help of qualified tax consultants.</p>

				<h3>LLP Registration</h3>
				<p>Registration of an LLP is the first step in creating your own business. The registration procedure is not complicated; you can do it yourself or, if you wish, use the services of specialized companies. </p>

				<h3>Tax Regime Change</h3>
				<p>In order to save on taxes, the owners of LLP on the general regime often think about changing the tax regime and switching to the "simplified" regime. In practice, such a change of regime does not always justify itself in terms of saving on tax payments, but this procedure remains popular among entrepreneurs.</p>
